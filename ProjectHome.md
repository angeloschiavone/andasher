Unofficial version of Dasher for Android (if you are looking for the official one see here http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/)
I coded this in my spare time; at the moment is possible to write-type by using both touch and tilting (including reverse axis tilting) but dictionary is english only.
Any help is appreciated.
here is what Dasher is (from Inference group website):

Dasher is an information-efficient text-entry interface, driven by natural continuous pointing gestures. Dasher is a competitive text-entry system wherever a full-size keyboard cannot be used - for example,
  * when operating a computer one-handed, by joystick, touchscreen, trackball, or mouse;
  * when operating a computer with zero hands (i.e., by head-mouse or by eyetracker);
  * on a palmtop computer;
  * on a wearable computer.

The eyetracking version of Dasher allows an experienced user to write text as fast as normal handwriting - 29 words per minute; using a mouse, experienced users can write at 39 words per minute.
Dasher can be used to write efficiently in any language.
Dasher is fast and fun to learn. (If you don't believe us, see what users round the world say.)
Dasher is free software.
